Please note that with this approach, the initial render on the server-side will not have access to the data fetched from RxDB. If you need to pre-populate the store with data on the server-side, you'll need to find alternative ways to fetch and serialize the data during SSR and hydrate the store on the client-side.

# TODO

- sync rxdb to redux based on sync from server (rxdb does resolution
  and is single source truth)

# TODO Later

- The note text should really be the id to enable sharing between notes
